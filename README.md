# 🏛️ OpenAI to Z Challenge: Discovering Lost Amazonian Civilizations

This repository documents my participation in the **OpenAI to Z Challenge**, a groundbreaking initiative to uncover hidden archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest using open-source data and advanced AI models (like OpenAI's GPT-4.1 and o3/o4 mini).

## 🌍 Project Overview

> “Legends speak of a lost city of Z buried deep within the Amazon. With modern tools and AI, we’re turning myth into method.”

This challenge combines archaeology, satellite data, and artificial intelligence to trace possible sites of ancient civilizations—using:
- LIDAR scans
- Historical and colonial maps
- Indigenous oral histories
- Satellite imagery
- OpenAI models for hypothesis generation and site validation

## 🧠 My Approach

This project follows a structured path:
1. **Data Collection** – Satellite imagery, LIDAR, historical maps
2. **AI Augmentation** – Use GPT-4.1 to analyze, interpret and triangulate locations
3. **Geospatial Analysis** – QGIS, Python, geospatial libraries for data modeling
4. **Verification** – Multiple-method validation (textual, spatial, historical)
5. **Documentation** – Reproducible, step-by-step approach for others to verify

## 🗂 Repository Structure

📁 data/ → raw and processed geospatial datasets
📁 notebooks/ → exploratory notebooks and AI-assisted analysis
📁 scripts/ → processing and modeling scripts
📁 outputs/ → visualizations, maps, and discovery candidates
📁 references/ → literature, maps, colonial diaries

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- 🧠 OpenAI GPT-4.1 + o3/o4 mini
- 🛰️ Satellite & LIDAR data (NASA, MapBiomas, etc.)
- 📍 QGIS, Geopandas, Rasterio
- 🐍 Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- 🛠 GitHub Actions for CI

## 📅 Timeline

- 🟢 Challenge Start: ~May 15, 2025
- 🕒 Current Status: [18 days in]
- 🛑 Final Submission Deadline: June 29, 2025

## 📌 Goals

- Identify and verify **at least one** potential ancient site
- Provide reproducible, cross-validated analysis
- Share findings openly to benefit researchers and Indigenous knowledge systems

## ✅ To-Do List

- [ ] Data ingestion (LIDAR + satellite)
- [ ] GPT-based spatial analysis
- [ ] Site candidate prediction
- [ ] Multi-method verification
- [ ] Final write-up

## 🤝 Contributions

Currently an individual project, but open to:
- Collaborative brainstorming
- Historical context contributions
- Feedback from archaeologists, geographers, or data scientists
